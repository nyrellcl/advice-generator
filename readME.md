# advice-generator

# About
This was a challenge I completed on frontendmentor.io. This serves as my first project utilizing an API. I was really excited to start and complete this one. I've always been very curious how to actually link and apply an API to a project. This project was a really good and simple introduction to how an API interacts with the DOM and this project. 

# What I learned
I've seen a lot of what API's have to offer and I've been hesitant to try it out myself as it has always intimidated me. But, i decided to finally start a project that requires an API. This also helped me understand more about writing the JS code to successfully access the data from the API and convert it to Javascript. I learned this all while going through the project and reading the documentation and blogs of other developers. Doing this while working on the project, really helped ease myseld into the process without any hesitation. As a result I became fully dedicated to finishing this project and coming out with new knowledge about APIs.

This also strengthened my design skills and referencing a figma file to fully developing what was required.
